= {ms-msrun}[http://mspire.rubyforge.org/projects/ms-msrun]

A library for working with LC/MS runs.

== Examples

The following example will work on *mzXML*, *mzData* ( and *mzML* files, shortly)!

    require "ms/msrun" 

    Ms::Msrun.open("file.mzXML") do |ms|
      ms.start_time       # in seconds
      ms.end_time         # in seconds 

      ms.scan_count       # number of scans
      ms.scan_count(1)    # number of MS scans
      ms.scan_count(2)    # number of MS/MS scans, etc.

      ms.parent_basename_noext   # "file" (as recorded _in the xml_)
      ms.filename                # "file.mzXML"

      ms.scans.each do |scan|
        scan.num          # scan number
        scan.ms_level     # ms_level
        scan.time         # retention time in seconds
        scan.start_mz     # the first m/z value
        scan.end_mz       # the last m/z value
  
        # Precursor information
        pr = scan.precursor  # an Ms::Precursor object
        pr.mz
        pr.intensity      # does fast binary search if info not already given
        pr.parent         # the parent scan
        pr.charge_states  # Array of possible charge states

        # Spectral information
        spectrum = scan.spectrum
        spectrum.mzs          # Array of m/z values
        spectrum.intensities  # Array of m/z values
        spectrum.peaks do |mz, inten|
          puts "#{mz} #{inten}"   # print each peak on own line
        end
      end
    end

== Features

[*Fast*] uses xmlparser under the hood.
[*Unified*] one interface for all formats
[<b>Lazy evaluation of spectra</b>] By default, reads from IO when data is required.
[<b>Minimal Dependencies</b>] xmlparser (available for most distros and windows one-click installer) and axml.  Very nearly have supoort for LibXML.

== Installation

    gem install ms-msrun

The library currently relies on xmlparser (though LibXML is close to being
supported).  After installation of ms-msrun (which will automatically install
`axml`) issue this command to get instructions on installing xmlparser:

    ruby -rubygems -e 'require "axml" \ 
        puts AXML::Autoload.install_instructions(:xmlparser)'
